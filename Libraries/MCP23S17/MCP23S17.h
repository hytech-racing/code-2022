	MCP23S17.h
	Microchip MCP23S17 SPI I/O Expander Class for Teensy
	Leonid Pozdneev
	December 2018

	This library is a reworked version of the library posted on the Arduino website. It implements the same features
	and all function names are the same. The implementation of some functions is also similar (and comments too).

	Features Implemented (by word and by bit):
		I/O Direction
		Pull-ups On/Off
		Input inversion
		Output write
		Input read
		Generic byte read
		Generic byte write

	Interrupt features are not implemented in this version (will be added in the future).

	NOTE:	Addresses below are only valid when IOCON.BANK=0 (register addressing mode)
         	This means one of the control register values can change register addresses! (refer to the datasheet)
         	The default values is 0, so that's how we're using it. (Functionality when IOCON.BANK = 1 will be added in the future.)

         	All registers except ICON (0xA and 0xB) are paired as A/B for each 8-bit GPIO port.
        	Comments identify the port's name, and notes on how it is used.

        	*THIS CLASS ENABLES THE ADDRESS PINS ON ALL CHIPS ON THE BUS WHEN THE FIRST CHIP OBJECT IS INSTANTIATED!


  	USAGE:	All Read/Write functions except wordWrite are implemented in two different ways.
        	Individual pin values are set by referencing "pin #" and On/Off, Input/Output or High/Low where
        	portA represents pins 0-7 and portB 8-15. So to set the most significant bit of portB, set pin # 15.
        	To Read/Write the values for the entire chip at once, a word mode is supported buy passing a
        	single argument to the function as 0x(portB)(portA). I/O mode Output is represented by 0.
        	The wordWrite function was to be used internally, but was made public for advanced users to have
        	direct and more efficient control by writing a value to a specific register pair.
